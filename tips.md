### Flags

There are two flags to be aware of when writing a plugin:

<div class="mobile-side-scroller">
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Flag</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>safe</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          A boolean flag that informs Jekyll whether this plugin may be safely
          executed in an environment where arbitrary code execution is not
          allowed. This is used by GitHub Pages to determine which core plugins
          may be used, and which are unsafe to run. If your plugin does not
          allow for arbitrary code execution, set this to <code>true</code>.
          GitHub Pages still won’t load your plugin, but if you submit it for
          inclusion in core, it’s best for this to be correct!
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>priority</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          This flag determines what order the plugin is loaded in. Valid values
          are: <code>:lowest</code>, <code>:low</code>, <code>:normal</code>,
          <code>:high</code>, and <code>:highest</code>. Highest priority
          matches are applied first, lowest priority are applied last.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

To use one of the example plugins above as an illustration, here is how you’d
specify these two flags:

{% highlight ruby %}
module Jekyll
  class UpcaseConverter < Converter
    safe true
    priority :low
    ...
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
